# Python Notebook Collection

A comprehensive collection of Python examples and implementations covering fundamental concepts, data structures, file operations, and more.

## Features

### Core Python Concepts
- File I/O operations (read, write, append)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)
- Functional programming (recursion, lambda)
- Exception handling
- Variable scoping (local, nonlocal, global)

### Data Processing
- NumPy array operations
- Pandas DataFrame manipulation
- Map, filter, and reduce operations
- List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions

### Advanced Topics
- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
- Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Unit testing with pytest
- Big Data concepts overview
